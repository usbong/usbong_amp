# usbong_amp
The app creates static noise to defensively resolve, to a certain extent, the issue of noise generated by broadcasted BS streaming over various radio frequencies, e.g. wi-fi, cellular networks.

"amp" in usbong_amp can mean:
1) "ampere", which is the flow of electricity
2) "amplify", which means to magnify something like human capacity
3) "Autonomy", "Mastery", and "Purpose" from Daniel Pink

Other than this app, here are more possible solutions:

1) produce own "noise" to drown out the noise
2) leave the house, and come back after awhile
3) use a jammer
4) take down the cell site (signal tower)
5) endure/ignore
6) wait until the source of noise runs out of energy
7) talk to the source of the noise, which only results to more unnecessary noise/signals
8) listen to music
9) create an echo/audio feedback loop
--> e.g. speaker and mic; radio host and telephone caller; two mirrors reflecting each other; a person dreaming a dream, where he/she is dreaming a dream, where he/she is dreaming a dream..., i.e. a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream...
